## Getting Started

### Installation

Put the `Nord.bbColorScheme` file in BBEdit's "Color Schemes" support folder. (You can get there by choosing the folder name from the "Folders" submenu on the BBEdit application menu.)

### Activation

Open BBEdit's preferences and go to the Appearances pane. Select "Nord" as the editor color scheme and select "Dark" for the application appearance.

Note that BBEdit will let you select different default color schemes for light and dark system appearances. To set Nord as your Dark theme, follow the instructions above, then select "Light" for the application appearance and choose an appropriate theme. If you then select "Use system appearance" for application appearance, BBEdit will switch themes automatically when the system switches from light to dark.
